# AES67 Linux Daemon 

AES67 Linux Daemon is a Linux implementation of AES67 interoperability standard used to distribute and synchronize real time audio over Ethernet.    
See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES67](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES67) for additional info.    

# Introduction

The daemon is a Linux process that uses the [Merging Technologies ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 Driver](https://bitbucket.org/MergingTechnologies/ravenna-alsa-lkm/src/master) to handles PTP synchronization and RTP streams and exposes a REST interface for configuration and status monitoring.     

The **ALSA AES67 Driver** implements a virtual ALSA audio device that can be configured using _Sources_ and _Sinks_ and it's clocked using the PTP clock.    
A _Source_ reads audio samples from the ALSA playback device and sends RTP packets to a configured multicast address.    
A _Sink_ receives RTP packets from a specific multicast address and writes them to the ALSA capture device.    

A user can use the ALSA capture device to receive synchronized incoming audio samples from an RTP stream and the ALSA playback device to send synchronized audio samples to an RTP stream.    
The binding between a _Source_ and the ALSA playback device is determined by the channels used during the playback and the configured _Source_ channels map. The binding between a _Sink_ and the ALSA capture device is determined by the channels used while recoding and the configured _Sink_ channels map.    

The driver handles the PTP and RTP packets processing and acts as a PTP clock slave to synchronize with a master clock on the specified PTP domain.  All the configured _Sources_ and _Sinks_ are synchronized using the same PTP clock.    

The daemon communicates with the driver for control, configuration and status monitoring only by using _netlink_ sockets.    
The daemon implements a REST interface to configure and monitor the _Sources_, the _Sinks_ and PTP slave. See [README](daemon/README.md) for additional info.
It also implements SAP for sources announcements and discovery, and mDNS sources discovery and SDP transfer via RTSP.    

A WebUI is provided to allow daemon and driver configuration and monitoring. The WebUI uses the daemon REST API and exposes all the supported configuration paramaters for the daemon, the PTP slave clock, the _Sources_ and the _Sinks_. The WebUI can also be used to monitor the PTP slave status and the _Sinks_ status and to browse the remote SAP and mDNS sources.

### [daemon](daemon) directory ###

This directory contains the AES67 daemon source code.     
The daemon can be cross-compiled for multiple platforms and implements the following functionalities:

* control and configuration of up to 64 sources and sinks using the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 driver via netlink
* session handling and SDP parsing and creation
* HTTP REST API for control and configuration
* SAP discovery protocol and SAP browser
* mDNS sources discovery (using Avahi) and SDP transfer via RTSP
* IGMP handling for SAP, RTP and PTP multicast traffic

The directory also contains the daemon regression tests in the [tests](daemon/tests) subdirectory.  To run daemon tests install the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 kernel module enter the [tests](daemon/tests) subdirectory and run *./daemon-test -l all*    

See the [README](daemon/README.md) file in this directory for additional information about the AES67 daemon configuration and the HTTP REST API.

### [webui](webui) directory ###

This directory contains the AES67 daemon WebUI configuration implemented using React.    
With the WebUI a user can do the following operations:

* change the daemon configuration, this causes a daemon restart
* edit PTP clock slave configuration and monitor PTP slave status
* add and edit RTP Sources
* add, edit and monitor RTP Sinks
* browser remote SAP and mDNS RTP sources

### [3rdparty](3rdparty) directory ###

This directory is used to download the 3rdparty open source.
The [patches](3rdparty/patches) subdirectory contains patches applied to the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 module to compile with the Linux Kernel 5.x and on ARMv7 platforms and to enable operations on the network loopback device (for testing purposes).

 The ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 kernel module is responsible for:

* registering as an ALSA driver
* generating and receiving RTP audio packets
* PTP slave operations and PTP driven interrupt loop
* netlink communication between user and kernel

See [ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 Driver README](https://bitbucket.org/MergingTechnologies/ravenna-alsa-lkm/src/master/README.md) for additional information about the Merging Technologies module and for proper Linux Kernel configuration and tuning.

### [demo](demo) directory ###

This directory contains a the daemon configuration and status files used to run a short demo on the network loopback device. The [demo](#demo) is described below.

## Prerequisite ##
<a name="prerequisite"></a>
The daemon and the demo have been tested with **Ubuntu 18.04** distro on **x86/ARMv7** and with **Ubuntu 19.10** distro on **x86** using:

* Linux kernel version >= 4.14.x
* GCC  version >= 7.4 / clang >= 6.0.0 (C++17 support required, clang is required to compile on ARMv7)
* cmake version >= 3.10.2
* node version >= 8.10.0
* npm version >= 3.5.2
* boost libraries version >= 1.65.1
* Avahi service discovery (if enabled) >= 0.7

The BeagleBone® Black board with ARM Cortex-A8 32-Bit processor was used for testing on ARMv7.
See [Ubuntu 18.04 on BeagleBone® Black](https://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu) for additional information about how to setup Ubuntu on this board.

The [ubuntu-packages.sh](ubuntu-packages.sh) script can be used to install all the packages required to compile and run the AES67 daemon, the daemon tests and the [demo](#demo). See [PulseAudio and scripts notes](#notes).
 
## How to build ##
Make sure you have all the required packages installed, see [prerequisite](#prerequisite).    
To compile the AES67 daemon and the WebUI you can use the [build.sh](build.sh) script, see [script notes](#notes).        
The script performs the following operations:    

* checkout, patch and build the Merging Technologies ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 module
* checkout the cpp-httplib
* build and deploy the WebUI
* build the AES67 daemon

## Run the Demo ##
<a name="demo"></a>
To run a simple demo use the [run\_demo.sh](run_demo.sh) script. See [script notes](#notes).

The demo performs the following operations:

* setup system parameters
* stop PulseAudio (if installed). This uses and keeps busy the ALSA playback and capture devices causing instability problems. See [PulseAudio](#notes).
* install the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 module
* start the ptp4l as master clock on the network loopback device
* start the AES67 daemon and creates a source and a sink according to the status file in the demo directory
* open a browser on the daemon PTP status page
* wait for the Ravenna driver PTP slave to synchronize
* start recording on the configured ALSA sink for 60 seconds to the wave file in *./demo/sink_test.wav*
* start playing a test sound on the configured ALSA source
* wait for the recording to complete and terminate ptp4l and the AES67 daemon

## Interoperability tests ##
To run interoperability tests using the [Hasseb audio over Ethernet receiver](http://hasseb.fi/shop2/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=62) follow these steps:

* open the daemon configuration file *daemon.conf* and change the following parameters:
  * set network interface name to your Ethernet card, e.g.: *"interface\_name": "eth0"*
  * set default sample rate to 48Khz: *"sample\_rate": 48000*
* verify that PulseAdio is not running. See [PulseAudio](#notes).
* install the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 module with:     

      sudo insmod 3rdparty/ravenna-alsa-lkm/driver/MergingRavennaALSA.ko*

* run the daemon using the new configuration file:     
         
      aes67-daemon -c daemon.conf

* open the Daemon WebUi *http://[address:8080]* and do the following:
  * go to Config tab and verify that the sample rate is set to 48KHz
  * go to Sources tab and add a new Source using the plus button, set Codec to L24 and press the Submit button
  * go to Sources tab and click on the info icon on the right of the newly created source and copy the SDP file
* open the Hasseb WebUI and do the following:
  * deselect the "PTP slave only" checkbox to enable PTP master on Hasseb device
  * select the "Add SDP file manually" checkbox and copy the previous Source SDP into the SDP field
  * press the Submit button
* return to the daemon WebUI, click on the PTP tab and wait for the "PTP Status" to report "locked"
* open a shell on the Linux host and start the playback on the ravenna ALSA device. For example to playback a test sound use:

          speaker-test -D plughw:RAVENNA -r 48000 -c 2 -t sine

## Notes ##
<a name="notes"></a>

* All the scripts in this repository are provided as a reference to help setting up the system and run a simple demo.    
  They have been tested on **Ubuntu 18.04** and **19.10** distros only.    
* **PulseAudio** can create instability problems.    
Before running the daemon verify that PulseAudio is not running with:  

      ps ax | grep pulseaudio

  In case it's running try to execute the following script to stop it:

      daemon/scripts/disable_pulseaudio.sh

  If after this the process is still alive considering one of these two solutions and reboot the system afterwards:    
  * Uninstall it completely with:    

        sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio

  * Disable it by renaming the executable with:    
    
         sudo mv /usr/bin/pulseaudio /usr/bin/_pulseaudio

  Other methods to disable PulseAudio may fail and just killing it is not enough since it gets immediately re-spawned.
